<h3>Decades of Loyalty Shattered: My Vintage Watch Nightmare with Shreve & Co. ðŸ’”</h3>
<p></br>
My terrible online shopping experience serves as a cautionary tale. I've been a loyal customer of Shreve and Company since the middle 1980s, and because I've always loved what Shreve has to offer and the service they provide for purchases past and present, I was utterly shocked and disappointed by my recent interaction. My treasured vintage watch, sent in for service via your clunky online portal, was returned with new damage, making the original issue even worse. This experience has left me incredibly frustrated and deeply questioning my decades of loyalty. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service to express my profound dissatisfaction and seek a proper resolution.</p>
<p>Customer: Hello, I'm calling about a service request, reference number SR-54321. I'm absolutely furious about how my recent repair was handled.
CS Rep: I'm so sorry to hear that, sir/ma'am. Let me pull up your account with that reference number. Could you please tell me what happened?
Customer: What happened? I sent in my vintage watch, a piece I bought from you decades ago, and it came back <em>worse</em> than when I sent it in! There's a new scratch on the crystal, and the original issue with the movement isn't even fixed. This is completely unacceptable, especially after being a customer since the 1980s. I trusted you with this piece.
CS Rep: I completely understand your frustration. As a long-standing customer, you absolutely have the right to expect the highest quality service. I'm truly sorry for this oversight and the new damage to your watch. This is not the standard we aim for, especially with a valued client like yourself.
Customer: It's not just an oversight; it feels like a disregard for my loyalty. And honestly, your online service request system was a nightmare to navigate too. What are you going to do about this? I expect a full, proper repair, done correctly this time, and compensation for the new damage.
CS Rep: I hear you, and I assure you we take your concerns very seriously. We will absolutely arrange for the watch to be returned to our workshop, at no further cost to you, for a priority re-evaluation and repair by our master watchmakers. We will also address the new scratch on the crystal. As a gesture of our apology for the inconvenience and the poor experience, I'd like to offer you a credit for future services or purchases, on top of ensuring this repair is perfect.
Customer: I appreciate the offer, but my main concern is getting my watch back in the condition it deserves. I need to know this will be handled with the utmost care and professionalism this time.
CS Rep: Absolutely. I will personally oversee the re-service of your watch, and we'll provide you with regular updates throughout the process. We will also perform a final quality check with you before returning the item. Our goal is to restore your trust and ensure your complete satisfaction.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and to highlight the urgent need for Shreve to maintain the high standards I've known for decades.
